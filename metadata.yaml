  Kibana is an open source analytics and visualization platform designed to work with Elasticsearch.
  You use Kibana to search, view, and interact with data stored in Elasticsearch indices. You can easily
  perform advanced data analysis and visualize your data in a variety of charts, tables, and maps.

  Kibana makes it easy to understand large volumes of data. Its simple, browser-based interface enables
  you to quickly create and share dynamic dashboards that display changes to Elasticsearch queries in real time.
